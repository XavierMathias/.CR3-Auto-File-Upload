This bash script will automate a task for my photography business. It would eliminate the manual labor of moving large amounts of files and create several directories that I use to organize my photos. 

It would do the following:
1.Detect when specific SD card has been inserted into the SD Port
2. Check if the back drives are connected, if not selecta target directory
3. Create predetermined file structure
4. Copy and move files from SD card to backup drive
5. Report that files has been backed up
